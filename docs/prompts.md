# Prompts & Responses

This file is automatically maintained by a Claude Code hook. Every user prompt and Claude response in this project is appended here when the hook fires.

Hook script: `.claude/hooks/record-prompts.sh`
Hook events: `UserPromptSubmit` (captures prompt), `Stop` (captures response)

### Prompt

For this project create a docs/prompts.md and add project-specific claude hook to record all prompts and responses, include this one if possible

### Response

Done. Here's what was created:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.claude/settings.json` | Project-level hooks config wiring `UserPromptSubmit` + `Stop` events |
| `.claude/hooks/record-prompts.sh` | Script that parses hook JSON from stdin and appends to `docs/prompts.md` |
| `docs/prompts.md` | The log file, seeded with this conversation |

**How it works:**
- On `UserPromptSubmit`: hook receives `{"prompt": "..."}` via stdin → appends a `### Prompt` section
- On `Stop`: hook receives `{"transcript_path": "..."}` via stdin → extracts the last assistant message from the JSONL transcript → appends a `### Response` section

Each entry is timestamped and separated with `---`. From the next prompt onward, logging is fully automatic.

### Prompt

/write-spec Create a sliding window rate limiter, no GC, O(1) implementation

### Response

No issue tracker or git history detected — this is a fresh Java project. I'll work from the description you provided. Before writing the spec, I need to clarify a few things:

---

**Clarifying questions (please answer all in one reply):**

1. **Algorithm variant** — "Sliding window" can mean two things. Which do you want?
   - *Sliding window log*: exact timestamps per request, precise but memory-heavy
   - *Sliding window counter*: two adjacent fixed buckets weighted by overlap, approximate but constant-space — this is the typical "no-GC, O(1)" variant. Is this the one?

2. **Scope of "no GC"** — Does this mean:
   - No heap allocations after initialization (pure off-heap or pre-allocated ring buffers)?
   - Or just no per-request object allocation (primitives/arrays only, GC may still run)?

3. **Granularity** — Single-key (one global rate) or multi-key (per-user/IP, etc.)? If multi-key, what's the expected key space size?

4. **Concurrency** — Must it be thread-safe? Lock-free? Or single-threaded only?

5. **Configuration** — What parameters does the rate limiter accept? (e.g., `limit`, `windowDurationMs`?) Fixed at construction time or dynamically changeable?

6. **Time source** — System clock (`System.currentTimeMillis`) or injectable clock (for testability)?

7. **Return type** — Should `tryAcquire()` return a boolean? Or also expose remaining capacity and retry-after metadata?

8. **Target Java version** — Any minimum version constraint (e.g., Java 11, 17, 21)?

9. **Out of scope** — Anything you explicitly don't want: persistence, distributed coordination, metrics/observability hooks?

### Prompt

1. Sliding window log 2. no per-request object allocation 3. key is not required 4. single threaded 5. fixed at construction: limt and windowDurationMs 6. injectable clock 7. return boolean 8. latest Java 9. n/a

### Response

Spec written to `docs/specs/sliding-window-log-rate-limiter.md`. Key design decisions captured:

**The core trick** — a ring buffer sized to `limit` is all you need. When full, only the oldest slot (`timestamps[head]`) matters: if it's expired, overwrite it and advance `head`; if not, deny. One array read + optional write = O(1) with zero allocation.

**Boundary condition** — `now - oldest >= windowDurationMs` (inclusive) is explicitly called out in the algorithm and the edge-case table, since off-by-one here is the most common bug.

**Pre-fill phase** — when `count < limit` the buffer isn't full yet, so requests are always allowed and slots fill sequentially (no `head` movement needed).

Let me know if you'd like any section revised, or if you're ready to move to implementation.

### Prompt

use write-java-code and write-java-test skills to implement the main code and test code

### Response

All **17 tests pass** (0 failures, 0 skipped). Here's a summary of what was created:

**`src/main/java/dev/knyuen/ratelimiter/SlidingWindowRateLimiter.java`**
- `long[] timestamps` ring buffer pre-allocated at construction
- `tryAcquire()`: one array read, one conditional write — no allocation
- Guava `Preconditions.checkArgument` / `checkNotNull` for constructor validation

**`src/test/java/dev/knyuen/ratelimiter/SlidingWindowRateLimiterTest.java`**

| Test | Covers |
|---|---|
| `WHEN_requests_within_limit_THEN_all_return_true` | First `limit` calls |
| `WHEN_requests_exceed_limit_THEN_returns_false` | `limit + 1` call |
| `WHEN_oldest_exactly_at_boundary_THEN_returns_true` | `now - oldest == windowDurationMs` (inclusive) |
| `WHEN_oldest_just_inside_window_THEN_returns_false` | `windowDurationMs - 1` case |
| `WHEN_window_expires_THEN_allowed_again` | Full cycle: fill → deny → expire → refill |
| `GIVEN_limit_1_*` (2 tests) | Minimal buffer edge case |
| `GIVEN_invalid_limit_*` (3 parameterized) | `0, -1, MIN_VALUE` |
| `GIVEN_invalid_window_*` (3 parameterized) | `0, -1, MIN_VALUE` |
| `WHEN_clock_is_null_THEN_throws` | Null clock |
| `WHEN_requests_arrive_at_different_times_*` (3 parameterized) | Interleaved timing across slots |

### Response

The hook script exists. I just need to wire the hooks into `.claude/settings.json`.

### Prompt

This is a test prompt, verify if this prompt and response are recorded

### Response

Prompt recording is now active. Every prompt you submit and every response Claude gives will be automatically appended to `docs/prompts.md`.

- Hook script: `~/.claude/hooks/record-prompts.sh` (already existed)
- Config: `.claude/settings.json` — hooks wired for `UserPromptSubmit` and `Stop`
- Log file: `docs/prompts.md` (already existed with prior history)

### Prompt

Load write-spec skill and update the spec that the boolean return type is unsuitable for equity trading, suggest better alternatives

### Response

The spec is updated. Here's a summary of every change:

**New section — `## Return Type`** (before Design):
- Explains why `boolean` is unsuitable: callers can't schedule precise retries, can't feed retry-after into order management systems, and can't produce machine-readable throttle metadata for audit/risk.
- Presents three zero-allocation alternatives and recommends **Option A: `long tryAcquire()`** — returns `0` (permit granted) or `> 0` (milliseconds until next permit, i.e. retry-after).

**FR-3** — updated to require both permit decision and retry-after information.

**Algorithm pseudocode** — `return true/false` replaced with `return 0L` / `return (windowDurationMs - (now - oldest))`.

**API signature** — `boolean tryAcquire()` → `long tryAcquire()` with updated Javadoc.

**User stories, edge cases, acceptance criteria** — all updated to reflect the `long` contract.

**Open Questions** — two follow-ups added: clock resolution (ms vs ns for equity infra) and whether `remainingPermits` will eventually be needed (Option C).

### Prompt

update the cover image in the README.md if appropriate

### Response

Updated `boolean ok` → `long retryMs` in the banner's code snippet. The README body (algorithm bullets and API example) also still references the old `boolean` / `true`/`false` contract — let me know if you'd like those updated too.

### Prompt

git commit and push to origin

### Response

Updated `boolean ok` → `long retryMs` in the banner's code snippet. The README body (algorithm bullets and API example) also still references the old `boolean` / `true`/`false` contract — let me know if you'd like those updated too.

### Prompt

review if there is any optimization can be done

### Response

The code is quite clean already. Here are two small but valid optimizations:

**1. Fast path: remove unnecessary `head` addition and modulo**

During the fast path (`count < limit`), `head` is **always `0`** — it only advances in the slow path, which only runs once `count == limit`. So the expression simplifies:

```
(head + count) % limit  →  count   (since head=0, count < limit)
```

**2. Slow path: replace modulo with conditional increment**

`head = (head + 1) % limit` performs an integer division at runtime. A branch avoids it and is often faster on modern CPUs:

```java
if (++head == limit) head = 0;
```

Applied:

### Prompt

load write-java-code skill and review the class

### Response

One violation of the skill's **Braces** convention — line 72 uses a braceless `if` for a single statement:

```java
if (++head == limit) head = 0;
```

### Prompt

Avoid duplicated (now - oldest)

### Response

`elapsed` is now computed once and reused in both the condition and the return value.

### Prompt

load write-java-code skill and review the class

### Response

The skill now includes a **Local Variables** rule (new since last review): declare local variables `final` when not reassigned.

Reviewing `tryAcquire()` against this:

```java
long now = clock.getAsLong();    // never reassigned → should be final
long oldest = timestamps[head];  // never reassigned → should be final
long elapsed = now - oldest;     // never reassigned → should be final
```

All three violations. Fixing them:
